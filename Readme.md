# JavaScript

## JavaScript Basics

JavaScript is a high-level, object oriented, multi-paradigm programming language which is mainly used for web development.

> i. It's _high-level_ because we don't have to worry about complex low level stuffs like memory management (like C or C++)

> ii. Base on Objects, for storing most kinds of data.

> iii. _Multi-paradigm_ because we can use different styles of programming like imperative, declarative etc.

### Role of JavaScript in Web Development

3 core technologies of the are HTML, CSS and JavaScript

HTML - Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is used to structure the contents of the page.

CSS - Cascading Style Sheet. CSS is used for presentation of the content like styling, layouts etc.

JavaScript is used to add dynamic and interactive effects on a webpage.

Web Application Development can divided into

1. Front end Web Development
2. Back end Web Development

Linking a JavaScript file

to link an external JavaScript file with a HTML file we use the <script> tag

```
    <script src="./index.js"></script>
    <script async src="./index.js"></script>
    <script defer src="./index.js"></script>
```

If we the _async_ or the _defer_ attribute then the script file will be downloaded asynchronously. We'll discuss this in details later.
